Both for and while loops are used to iterate and execute a set of statements repeatedly but both of them have their own preference for solving a certain problem. We can use any one of them to achieve the same but the efficiency and complexity wonâ€™t be the same for both of the loops. We use for loops when we want to iterate on an iterable object (array, list, etc.) or we know the exact number of times we need to iterate where as we use a while loop to iterate until a specific condition is true. So based on the task we must choose either a for or while loop.
